# Star Guardian

StarGuardian is a game that was developed in collaboration with:

Kevin Tawatstjerna

Justin Nicholls

Alec White

as part of a project for CS4483 at the University of Western Ontario (Game Design course). 
The objective of the game is to reach the end of the level without running out of fuel. 
Along the way, the player will encounter "good" stars and "bad" stars, which increase
and drain fuel respectively. Additionally, fuel will passively drain over-time, which
forces the player to take risks for the reward of gaining more fuel. 

To download and play this game, you really only need the contents of the "StarGuardianFinal"
folder, which contains the working executable and associated data. Download the folder and 
run the exe (StarGuardian.exe). The game runs best at 1366x768.

For more in-game instructions, please refer to the "HELP" section in the game menu.

Additionally, difficulty and music can be toggled in the "OPTIONS" section.

Coded in Unity5 using C#.
